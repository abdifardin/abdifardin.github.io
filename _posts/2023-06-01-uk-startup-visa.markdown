  <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #856404;">⚠️ Important Update</h4>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The UK Startup Visa has been <strong>replaced by the UK Innovator Founder Visa</strong> as of April 2023. If you're considering applying for a UK entrepreneurship visa, please read my updated guide about the new visa route: <a href="/uk-innovator-visa" style="color: #856404; text-decoration: underline;">UK Innovator Founder Visa Guide</a>.</p>

The journey to secure a UK Startup Visa is quite complex, and this is a detailed account of my experience. From multiple rejections to final success, this post chronicles every step of the process to help future applicants understand what they're getting into.

	Important Notice
</h3>

If you are considering the UK as the foundation for your entrepreneurial ambitions, it's crucial to be informed about the recent changes in immigration policy. The Startup Visa, a once-popular route for overseas entrepreneurs, was officially discontinued in April 2023. However, this does not mark the end of opportunities for startups in the UK.

	The Application Journey
</h3>

The first phase of this process culminates in receiving the endorsement letter from the chosen endorsing body. Here's my detailed experience:

**1. Application to Endorsement Bodies**

The first step involved exploring the list of endorsement bodies. After reviewing their websites and other resources extensively, I shortlisted the most appropriate ones. I chose the best fit and applied through their provided platform, Dri.ai. The platform guided me through several steps, requiring various pieces of information including personal details, project details, financial projections, a business plan, and more. I made an initial payment of $350, which the endorsement body required to review my case.

**2. First Rejection (October 21, 2022)**

I received a response via email on October 21st, 2022. They had diligently reviewed my project and assigned an expert to evaluate it thoroughly. The assessment focused on three key factors: innovation, viability, and scalability. Unfortunately, they found it challenging to endorse my proposal at that stage, citing the need for a stronger alignment with these three criteria. However, they didn't completely reject my case and offered constructive feedback, leaving the door open for reapplication.

**3. Responding to the First Rejection**

After careful review of their feedback, I responded on October 23rd, expressing appreciation for their detailed review and outlining my intention to revise our business proposal based on their comments. Despite not hearing back for two days, I followed up on October 25th, and they promptly responded with helpful advice and resources.

**4. Second Rejection (December 1, 2022)**

After about a month of revising my business plan and financial forecasting based on their feedback, I sent them an update on November 16th. Unfortunately, after a series of follow-up emails, I received another rejection on December 1st. They appreciated my efforts but noted that my business plan was still missing key areas.

**5. Responding to the Second Rejection**

I thought there might have been some misunderstandings regarding aspects of my business plan, so I decided to clarify them in an email sent on December 6th. After some back-and-forth correspondence, we agreed to conduct market surveys and focus groups to gather more data to support my proposal.

**6. Third Attempt - Success (January 27, 2023)**

This time, I prepared a survey and sent it out to my network. I managed to collect detailed responses from ten experienced individuals. Alongside this, I revised my business plan and financial projections again. After sending my updated materials on January 14th, 2023, and several follow-up emails, I received the much-awaited acceptance on January 27th. They believed there was now sufficient evidence to proceed to the start-up endorsement stage.

**7. Interview (February 3, 2023)**

An email arrived on January 31st asking for my availability for an online interview on February 3rd. They also requested a copy of my passport, which I promptly provided. The interview took place on the agreed date and lasted for about 30 minutes. Although I was nervous about this stage, it turned out to be more of a formality and an opportunity for them to explain the next steps.

	Endorsement Letter Process
</h3>

Post-interview on January 31st, we didn't receive any communication for a while. Therefore, I decided to follow up on the status of the endorsement letter on February 6th, 2023.

They promptly responded on the same day, indicating that they were in the process of preparing the Innovation, Viability, and Scalability summary, which would form the basis of the endorsement letter. They also asked for further clarifications regarding my previous startup experiences and specific details about our team and plans. We exchanged several emails on February 6th to address their inquiries.

On February 7th, they shared a draft of the Innovation, Viability, and Scalability (IVS) paper with us. This document essentially serves as a preliminary version of the final endorsement letter's content. They requested that we review the details and notify them of any necessary modifications.

The document was shared with me in a .docx format, which I subsequently uploaded to Google Docs and shared back with them. This allowed us to collaboratively review the document, make necessary edits, and discuss various points through the commenting feature.

On February 8, 2023, our collaboration focused on the IVS document via Google Docs. On the same day, we received a draft of the endorsement letter which we proceeded to review and finalize. A few days later, on February 12, I requested that the issuance of the official endorsement letter be postponed until I could renew my passport. Severn Seed Finance (SSF) was accommodating and agreed to this request.

By February 13, SSF had sent over amended pre-endorsement documents for my signature. After carefully examining these documents, I signed and returned them. During this process, we encountered some minor issues related to spelling errors which required additional email exchanges and re-signing of the documents. Finally, on February 14, I signed the final version of the documents and sent them back to SSF.

**Important**: The endorsement letter has a validity period of only three months. This means you must submit your visa application within this timeframe, necessitating swift preparation of the remaining required documents.

	Preparing for the Visa Application
</h3>

Having secured the endorsement letter, I still required additional documentation: an English proficiency test at B2 level, a bank statement reflecting funds for 28 consecutive days, and a Tuberculosis (TB) test.

**English Proficiency Test**

The Home Office provided a list of approved English proficiency tests, including Pearson, Trinity College London, IELTS, and LanguageCert. After evaluating the available options, I discovered that Trinity College London doesn't offer testing services in Iraq. Initially, I opted not to choose IELTS due to higher costs and perceived difficulty. Therefore, I decided to proceed with LanguageCert.

However, a challenge arose just five days before the test date. Upon contacting LanguageCert to enquire about the payment and registration process, I was informed that they wouldn't be administering the test due to a scheduling conflict with the TOEFL examination. They planned to postpone it until the following month.

This situation put me in a tight spot. I couldn't wait for next month due to my endorsement letter's nearing expiry. I discovered that IELTS was conducting an exam at the end of that week, giving me only 3-4 days to prepare. Despite the difficulty of this academic exam (which included handwriting), I decided to register.

I found the speaking portion manageable, but the listening, writing, and reading parts seemed challenging. I was told to wait at least 15 days for results. Anticipating a score below the required B2, I started considering LanguageCert as a backup plan.

Thankfully, just a day before the LanguageCert registration, I received my IELTS scores. I had scored exactly 5.5, meeting the requirement for the startup visa.

**TB Test**

For certain countries, including Iraq, a TB test is required as part of the visa application process. Unfortunately, Iraq is listed as a country whose citizens or individuals who have recently traveled to Iraq within the past 6 months must undergo a TB test for the UK visa application.

Although you might not be Iraqi, if you have visited Iraq in the past 6 months, you are still required to undergo the TB test. The cost of the test is $150.

While the Home Office has an official center in Iran with a lower cost, I chose not to risk it due to time limitations and went with the IOM center in Erbil.

**Bank Statement**

Acquiring a bank statement was an intricate and ambiguous part of the application process. The Home Office mandates that an applicant must maintain a balance of at least £1280 in their bank account for a consecutive 28-day period. This account should be situated in the applicant's home country. Following this, an official document from the bank is required as proof.

However, I faced uncertainties - which banks were recognized by the Home Office, and what exchange rate should be used to calculate the £1280 equivalent in Iranian Rials.

In my pursuit for answers, I turned to local Iranian groups, searching for relevant discussions in Telegram chat groups. My queries were met with varied responses. Some suggested that the conversion rate should be closely aligned with the prevailing market rate. However, others were referring to the Oanda rate, which was significantly lower than the actual market rate. For instance, while the market rate stood at 50K Toman per pound, the Oanda rate was a mere 5K. This discrepancy was due to Oanda's reliance on rates provided by the Iranian government.

Initially, I opted to deposit funds using the real market rate. However, fluctuations in the market rate occasionally caused my account balance to dip below the required amount. To avoid this risk, I decided to utilize the Oanda rate.

I obtained a certificate from Meli Bank, denoted in Rials, that detailed my daily account balance over the stipulated 28-day period. To convert my balance into pounds, I used the Oanda rate. This was a simple process that involved printing the up-to-date conversion page from Oanda's website and attaching it to my bank statement.

	Visa Application
</h3>

For the application, I utilized an Iraqi credit card. Initially, I had estimated the sole expense to be the visa fee of around £387. However, during the application process, I discovered that an additional insurance fee was required. This fee, totalling approximately £1287, was applicable for a single person over a two-year visa period. This unexpected cost altered my initial calculations and required some time to gather the additional funds.

I deposited Iraqi Dinar into the credit card, which was then converted to pounds at a relatively fair exchange rate. In total, I deposited approximately 2,800,000 Dinar to cover the combined visa and insurance fees of £1675.

	Conclusion
</h3>

This comprehensive journey took approximately 8 months from start to finish. The process was challenging, requiring persistence through multiple rejections, careful attention to detail, and significant financial investment. However, it was ultimately worth it for the opportunity to start my entrepreneurial journey in the UK.

Key takeaways for future applicants:
- Be prepared for multiple rejection rounds and use feedback constructively
- Start preparing supporting documents early, especially if you're from certain countries requiring additional tests
- Budget for unexpected costs like insurance fees
- Pay close attention to exchange rates and financial requirements
- The endorsement letter has a short validity period, so plan accordingly

I hope this detailed account provides valuable insight to those considering or currently in the process of applying for similar visas. The key is patience, meticulous preparation, and persistence. Good luck!
