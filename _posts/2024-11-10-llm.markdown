Smart ui/ux or llm-based interface?
With the advancement of the AI and machine learning, a new vibe of the user interface has been introduced. The LLM based interface is the new trend in the market. The LLM based interface is the interface that is based on the language model.

I see a lot of people are thinking about providing an llm based interface for their users, ignoring the smart ui/ux. But, is it the right choice? Let's discuss.
there's a problem wih this approach.
You are giving the users a full freedom to write whatever they want, Whilst most of the users do not know what they want. They are looking for a smart interface that can guide them to the right path. The smart ui/ux is the interface that is designed in a way that it can guide the users to the right path. It can help the users to find what they are looking for.
