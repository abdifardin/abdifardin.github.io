[Hotorder](https://hotorder.co.uk) is an online food order and delivery service. It acts as an intermediary between independent take-out food outlets and customers.
<br/>The platform allows customers to search for local take-out restaurants to place orders online,
and to choose from pick-up or delivery options.

Founded and developed by Softcode in 2016 and launched the service in February 2017.
