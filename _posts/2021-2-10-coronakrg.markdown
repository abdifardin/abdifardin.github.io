At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were entrusted with a critical project from the Sulaymaniyah Health Organization: to construct an online database system for managing COVID-19 test results. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, we promptly set to work.

In a swift span of just one month, I was able to deliver a fully customized, React-backed database system to the client. This intuitive platform was engineered to empower government staff, allowing them to add and manage records seamlessly. In parallel, it also provided patients with the ability to check their test results conveniently.

Our prompt response and the user-friendly nature of our system allowed the Sulaymaniyah Health Organization to streamline their operations during a crucial time. In a broader perspective, it underscored our commitment to delivering cutting-edge solutions when it matters the most.
