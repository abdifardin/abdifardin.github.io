VidClip.ai was born during the [VEED x fal.ai Gen AI Hackathon](https://lu.ma/989p71d2?tk=lmSXIP) in May 2025, a three-day intensive coding event held at VEED's office in the heart of Shoreditch, London. Together with my teammate Sirwan, we tackled the challenge of revolutionizing how creators generate short-form content from long videos.

## The Hackathon Experience

The event brought together 300+ developers, AI enthusiasts, and industry leaders for what turned out to be one of the most innovative hackathons in London's AI startup scene. With a prize pool worth over Â£100k and sponsorship from industry giants like VEED, fal.ai, ElevenLabs, Photoroom, and [Sieve](https://www.sievedata.com/), the stage was set for groundbreaking innovation.

### Event Timeline

**Day 1 (May 30)** - Opening ceremony and networking session where we formed teams and explored project ideas
**Day 2 (May 31)** - The main hacking day! Development officially began at 11:00am with non-stop coding through the night
**Day 3 (June 1)** - Final submissions and winner announcements

## The Problem We Solved

Current short video generation tools take a one-size-fits-all approach, often missing the nuanced preferences of content creators. We identified a gap in the market for intelligent, customizable short video creation that goes beyond simple trimming and basic AI selection.

## Our Innovative Solution

VidClip.ai introduces a revolutionary approach to short video generation through our unique two-stage process:

### 1. Intelligent Video Analysis

Using [Sieve's powerful video AI APIs](https://www.sievedata.com/), our system comprehensively analyzes long-form videos by:

-   **Object Detection**: Identifying all objects, people, and items within the video
-   **Scene Understanding**: Extracting context, activities, and mood from different segments
-   **Content Digitization**: Creating a searchable database of video elements and references
-   **Temporal Analysis**: Understanding the flow and pacing of content throughout the video

### 2. Interactive AI-Powered Customization

What sets VidClip.ai apart is our interactive chatbot interface that allows users to:

-   **Person-Specific Clips**: "Show me segments featuring John" or "Create a clip focusing on the speaker"
-   **Mood-Based Generation**: "Extract fun moments" or "Find emotional/dramatic scenes"
-   **Activity Filtering**: "Show cooking segments" or "Focus on eating scenes"
-   **Object Highlighting**: "Create clips featuring specific products or items"
-   **Custom Combinations**: Mix and match multiple preferences for highly targeted content
