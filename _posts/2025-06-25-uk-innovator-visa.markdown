  <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2e7d32;">✅ Current Information</h4>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">This guide covers the <strong>UK Innovator Founder Visa</strong>, which replaced the UK Startup Visa in April 2023. This is the current entrepreneurship visa route for the UK. For information about the discontinued Startup Visa, please see my <a href="/uk-startup-visa" style="color: #2e7d32; text-decoration: underline;">previous guide</a>.</p>

After obtaining a UK Startup Visa and spending a year and a half building my business in the UK, I recently transitioned to the new Innovator Founder Visa. This post shares my experience with this new visa route, outlining the challenges and lessons I learned.

<h3 style="text-align: left; border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> 
	Background and Context
</h3>

I had been in the UK for approximately 18 months on a Startup Visa. As part of the initial agreement with my endorsing body, I enrolled in their coaching program, which involved regular monthly meetings to ensure the business aligned with market requirements and Home Office criteria.

My endorsing body was a legacy endorsing body, meaning that even though the Startup Visa was discontinued, they remained responsible for my progress and my transition to the Innovator Founder Visa.


<h3 style="text-align: left; border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> 
	Starting the Application Process
</h3>

In July 2024, I approached my endorsing body to begin the process early, as my business was nearly ready. We had a functional website and product and were actively engaging with the market.

However, the endorsing body advised allowing more time, as the Home Office is stringent about meeting all criteria.  Finally, after our last meeting in December, I decided to proceed.

#### Application Process
Starting from December 1st, I started to work on the application process. I updated the business plan and financial plan based on the feedback from the endorsing body.

On December 17th, I submitted the completed application form. The fee for the "Same Business" route was £1,200 + VAT (£1,440 total). This was £200 above the standard rate to account for the additional time required to verify that I met both the previous Startup Visa criteria and the new Innovator Founder requirements.

	Endorsement Success
</h3>

The process with the endorsing body was relatively straightforward. About a month after applying, I received the endorsement letter.

On January 25th, I received the endorsement letter along with the assessment sheet and assessor's comments. They said:


<h3 style="text-align: left; border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> 
	Home Office Visa Application
</h3>

I completed my Innovator Founder Visa application on the Home Office website on February 10th and booked an appointment with TLS Contact for February 13th. My visa application submission was officially dated February 13th.

The total cost for the visa application was £4,740, which included £1,590 for the visa fee and £3,150 for the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) fee.

The application was expected to be processed within 8 weeks, but it took over 3 months.

**First Information Request (April 3rd)**

The first update I received from the Home Office was on April 3rd. They requested more information, including the business plan and endorsement letter from my original Start-up Visa application. They also asked for comprehensive evidence of business activity, such as financial records and marketing efforts, and a clarification on how I was managing my time while allegedly working another full-time job.

**Second Information Request (April 8th)**

After I submitted the requested documents, a second request arrived on April 8th. This time, the Home Office focused on my team. They asked about my co-founders' roles and application plans, our working relationships, and for evidence of our first hire. They also requested more proof of our marketing activities and the development history of our Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

**Third Information Request (April 22nd)**

The third and final request came on April 22nd, focusing on financial sustainability and hiring. The Home Office questioned how the business could afford to pay an employee's salary without any revenue and asked for justification for hiring from outside the UK. They also wanted to see our revenue projections and, once more, asked for details about my co-founders.

I responded to all their requests, and on May 21st, I finally received approval.

	Key Differences from Startup Visa
</h3>

**Legacy Endorsing Body Support**

One significant advantage of transitioning from a Startup Visa was having a legacy endorsing body. They remained responsible for monitoring progress and conducting the 12 and 24-month progress checks, providing continuity throughout the visa journey.

**Enhanced Scrutiny**

The Innovator Founder Visa involves much more detailed scrutiny compared to the Startup Visa. The Home Office requested extensive evidence of:
- Actual business operations and revenue generation plans
- Employee hiring processes and financial sustainability
- Marketing and sales activities
- Co-founder relationships and contributions
- Historical business development

**Higher Financial Requirements**

The financial requirements are more stringent, with greater emphasis on demonstrating how the business will become financially sustainable and generate revenue.

<h3 style="text-align: left; border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> 
	Conclusion and Key Takeaways
</h3>

The transition from Startup Visa to Innovator Founder Visa was challenging but ultimately successful. The entire process took approximately five months from initial discussions to final approval.

**Key Lessons Learned:**

1. **Start Early**: Begin discussions with your endorsing body well in advance of your current visa's expiration.
2. **Maintain Detailed Records**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of all business activities, partnerships, and financial transactions.
3. **Prepare for Scrutiny**: The Home Office will request extensive evidence of genuine business operations.
4. **Co-founder Considerations**: Document any team additions carefully from the outset.
5. **Financial Planning**: Demonstrate a clear path to revenue generation and financial sustainability.
6. **Legacy Endorsing Body Advantage**: Having an existing relationship with an endorsing body can streamline the process.

**Important Reminders:**

- The endorsement letter is valid for only 3 months.
- Endorsement does not guarantee visa approval.
- The "Same Business" route is available for those transitioning from a Startup Visa.
- Regular monitoring and progress checks continue after visa approval.

The Innovator Founder Visa represents a more mature, business-focused approach to UK entrepreneurship visas. While the requirements are more stringent than the previous Startup Visa, the route provides a clear pathway for serious entrepreneurs looking to build scalable businesses in the UK.

For those considering this route, thorough preparation, detailed documentation, and early engagement with endorsing bodies are essential for success. The investment in time and effort is significant, but the opportunities for building a business in the UK make it worthwhile for committed entrepreneurs.
