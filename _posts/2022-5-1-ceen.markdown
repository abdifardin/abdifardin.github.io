Ceen is an online voting application and my recent project.
<br/>The polls is not just some boring academics or social questions, it could be anything, from food testing to sport, fun, daily events and so on.

We developed the project by the cutting edge techs and solutions.
The entire project developed by a small in-house team, which includes a UI/UX designer and a react native devleoper and I for admin panel development and project management.

The result was great. A smoth user interface and scalable project, secure and reliable
