# Welcome! I'm Fakhruddin Abdi

I'm a full-stack developer and entrepreneur with over a decade of experience building innovative software solutions. As both a hands-on developer and strategic leader, I've worn many hats‚Äîfrom CTO to CEO‚Äîwhile maintaining my passion for creating technology that makes a meaningful impact.

> **Interested in my professional background?** Take a look at my [detailed r√©sum√©](/resume) for a comprehensive overview of my experience and achievements.

## My Journey

---

### üå± 2000: The Digital Spark

My journey began in 2000 when I first encountered computers. What started as gaming and experimenting with photo and video editing tools gradually evolved into a deep fascination with technology's potential to solve real-world problems.

### üéì 2008: University & Foundation Building

Entering university as a software engineering student opened three key areas of exploration:

**Programming Mastery**: I dove deep into **C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP**, becoming particularly fascinated by **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and how it brought code to life through structured, reusable patterns.

**Innovation in Compression**: I developed a compression algorithm remarkably similar to **Pied Piper** from the [Silicon Valley series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/). This lossless compression system employed the [Huffman algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) at the byte level. I even [presented it publicly](http://computer-08.blogfa.com/post/184) and built a working C++ application.

	<img style="width: 90%; border-radius: 8px;" src="/assets/images/about/piedpiper.jpg" />
</a>

**Network Architecture**: I developed expertise in network science, mastering tools like [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) and [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/). My final project focused on network packet monitoring, deepening my understanding of protocol interactions.

**Artificial Intelligence**: I built a MATLAB application that trained models for flower recognition‚Äîan early glimpse into what would become today's machine learning revolution.

**Web Development Transition**: During my final two years, I shifted focus to web development, even teaching courses to newer students. I evolved from HTML/jQuery/Bootstrap to modern **HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS/SCSS**, while exploring backend development with **PHP frameworks** including Symfony, Cake, and ultimately **Laravel** for its elegant MVC architecture.

### üíº 2012: Professional Beginnings

My first role at a construction company in Sanandaj introduced me to **C#** and **WPF** with **MVVM architecture**. While Microsoft technologies felt restrictive, this experience broadened my technical foundation.

I then discovered my passion for frontend development, diving into **Angular** (starting with version 1) and later **ReactJS**. The shift to **functional programming** in 2014 was transformative‚Äîthe elegance of **pure functions** and simplified architecture resonated deeply with my development philosophy.

### üöÄ 2013: Zeyton - Building at Scale

As developer-turned-CTO at [Zeyton](/zeyton), I led technical strategy for a venture that secured significant investment.<br/>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between">
	<p style="width: 50%"> We relocated to Erbil, where we started from ground zero. </p>
	<a style="width: 50%" href="/assets/images/about/office-early.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img style="width: 90%; border-radius: 8px;" src="/assets/images/about/office-early.jpg" />
	</a>
</div>

I took the reins of building a technical team and charted out the strategies from tech stack selection to release schedules and plans.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 10px">
	<p style="width: 50%"> In the beginning, our team was a compact unit. </p>
	<a style="width: 50%" href="/assets/images/about/team-early.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img style="width: 90%; border-radius: 8px;" src="/assets/images/about/team-early.jpg" />
	</a>
</div>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between">
	<p style="width: 50%"> However, it didn't take long for us to expand and welcome more members into our growing team. </p>
	<a style="width: 50%" href="/assets/images/about/team-after.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img style="width: 90%; border-radius: 8px;" src="/assets/images/about/team-after.jpg" />
	</a>
</div>

I had the privilege of working with numerous remarkable companies as a third-party, including [Blazegraph](https://blazegraph.com/), who assisted us in loading freebase data onto their graph database.
Undoubtedly, it was an enriching experience.

We successfully built the first version and showcased it to our stakeholders.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 15px;">
	<a href="/assets/images/about/presentation-zeyton-3.jpg" target="_blank">

		<img style="width: 80%; border-radius: 8px;" src="/assets/images/about/presentation-zeyton.jpg"/>
	</a>
</div>

Though the project was ultimately discontinued due to management changes, the experience provided invaluable lessons in scaling technology teams and products.

### üè¢ 2016: Softcode - Entrepreneurial Independence

Following Zeyton, Dr. Layik and I co-founded [Softcode](https://softcode.co.uk/), giving us the freedom to pursue our own innovative projects.

**Fotomantic**: Our first venture was a social platform emphasizing topics over traditional friendship networks‚Äîessentially Instagram with a twist. We built an MVP using Firebase and graph database technology, validating the concept before pivoting due to financial sustainability challenges.

**Hotorder**: We then developed [Hotorder](/Hotorder), a multi-shop, white-label food delivery platform targeting the UK market. Using **Meteor and ReactJS**, we delivered the first version within two months and successfully onboarded several restaurants before financial constraints led us to focus on client projects.

### 2017: Harzaan - Market Leadership
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 10px">
	<p style="width: 50%"> I didn't give up with startups, I ventured into a new project -
		<a href="/harzaan" target="_blank">
			Harzaan
		</a>.
		<br/>Harzaan is a platform for classified ads for Iraq market.
  </p>
	<a style="width: 50%" href="/assets/images/about/harzaan-first.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img style="width: 90%; border-radius: 8px;" src="/assets/images/about/harzaan-first.jpg" />
	</a>
</div>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 10px">
	<p style="width: 50%"> I assembled a team in Iran and launched Harzaan as a classified ads service for the users in Iraq. </p>
	<a style="width: 50%" href="/assets/images/about/office-sna-old.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img style="width: 90%; border-radius: 8px;" src="/assets/images/about/office-sna-old.jpg" />
	</a>
</div>

We built and released the first version in 2017. The response was overwhelming, with numerous people posting their ads on Harzaan. In the first month alone, we saw over 5K downloads. This rapid growth persisted, and we hit 50K downloads in the next six months. Daily ad postings reached about 200 per day.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 10px">
	<p style="width: 50%"> Our application to the Science and Technology Park Of Kurdistan was accepted and they supported us with office space and mentorship. </p>
	<a style="width: 50%" href="/assets/images/about/office-sna.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img style="width: 90%; border-radius: 8px;" src="/assets/images/about/office-sna.jpg" />
	</a>
</div>

At this stage, I started seeking investors to finance our advertising efforts and expand our full-time team.

After negotiations with several potential partners, we reached an agreement with [Box Advertisement](https://boxads.co).

For the initial two years, I worked out of our Iran office, managing the teams. Later, I relocated to Erbil to gain a deeper understanding of the market.

Then came the COVID-19 pandemic...

I had to return to Iran, but six months later, I moved back to Sulaymaniyah, where I continued serving as the CEO/CTO of Harzaan, focusing on establishing Harzaan as a market leader in Iraq.

We successfully developed [NDB project](/ndb/) which is a complete ecosystem including mobile applications, administrative interfaces, and robust backend architecture.

### üöÄ 2025: agga.ai - The Next Frontier

As 2025 begins, my full focus is on AGGA.ai‚Äîa no-code AI web builder that reimagines how software is created. AGGA empowers users to build fully functional, scalable websites and internal tools simply by describing what they want. It decouples logic from implementation using a unique schema-driven compiler, making development faster, more modular, and accessible to non-technical users.
