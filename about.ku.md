## My Journey

### ðŸŒ± 2000: The Digital Spark

My journey began in 2000 when I first encountered a computer. What started as playing games and experimenting with photo and video editing tools gradually blossomed into a deep fascination with technology's power to solve real-world problems.

### ðŸŽ“ 2008: University & Building the Foundation

Enrolling as a software engineering student opened up three key areas of exploration:

**Mastering Code**: I dove deep into **C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP**, becoming especially fascinated with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and how it brought code to life through structured, reusable patterns.

**Compression Innovation**: I developed a compression algorithm strikingly similar to **Pied Piper** from the show *Silicon Valley*. This lossless compression system utilized a byte-level **Huffman algorithm**. I even [presented it publicly](http://computer-08.blogfa.com/post/184) and built a functional C++ implementation.

### ðŸ’¼ 2012: The Professional Leap

My first role at a construction company in Sanandaj introduced me to **C#** and **WPF** with the **MVVM architecture**. Though Microsoft's technologies felt restrictive, the experience broadened my technical foundation.

I then discovered my passion for frontend development, diving into **Angular** (starting with version 1) and later **ReactJS**. The shift to **functional programming** in 2014 was transformativeâ€”the elegance of **pure functions** and simplified architecture resonated deeply with my development philosophy.
